Can't open network interface
----------------------------
When I run a script it gives me errors that it could not open the network interface.

- install wireshark and try again (perferred)*
- run the script as sudo

Installing Wireshark changes the permissions of your interfaces so that it can read them. I actually recommend this for several reasons. One it's better than running scripts as sudo and two wireshark is great :)
